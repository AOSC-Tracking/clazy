This package distributes the clang compiler and a compiler plugin called clazy.
clang and llvm were built from branch release_70 (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm.git 888225e7beebbdd82f6b6c7e139c2b094ea4faaa and https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang.git 0513b409d5e34b2d2a28ae21b6d620cc52de0e57).

See LICENSE-LLVM.TXT for clang's license.
See LICENSE-CLAZY.txt for clazy's license.
See README-CLAZY.md for more information and for how you can build clang and clazy to get these binaries yourself.
