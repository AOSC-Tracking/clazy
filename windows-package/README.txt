This package distributes the clang compiler and a compiler plugin called clazy.
clang and llvm were built from branch release_40 (llvm/6a630d742074be775ca242c52071f5dcc5538b5b and clang/a6a1d3f3aa6c1d0018d84c3d6c26a552075982ab).

See LICENSE-LLVM.TXT for clang's license.
See LICENSE-CLAZY.txt for clazy's license.
See README-CLAZY.md for more information and for how you can build clang and clazy to get these binaries yourself.
