BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

* Build and install llvm/clang trunk if your distro doesn't provide it (tested with clang 3.7)
  $ git clone https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm.git <some_directory>
  $ mkdir <some_directory>/build && cd <some_directory>/build
  $ ../configure --enable-optimized --prefix=<prefix> && make && make install

* Build the clang-lazy plugin
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make && make install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

You should now have the clazy command available to you, in <prefix>/bin/.
Compile your programs with it instead of clang++/g++.

Note that this command is just a convenience wrapper which calls:
clang++ -Xclang -load -Xclang ClangLazy.so -Xclang -add-plugin -Xclang clang-lazy

To make it the default compiler for cmake projects just:
export CXX="clazy"
Don't forget to clean and re-run cmake

To make it the default compiler for qmake projects hack the mkspec:
Edit mkspecs/common/clang.conf and change QMAKE_CXX to clazy instead of clang++
Then run qmake -spec linux-clang


Finally, you need to choose which checks to enable. This is done through CLAZY_CHECKS env variable.
For example:
export CLAZY_CHECKS="bogus-dynamic-cast,qmap-with-key-pointer,virtual-call-ctor"

Instead of using the env variable, you can also pass an argument to the compiler:
-Xclang -plugin-arg-clang-lazy -Xclang bogus-dynamic-cast,qmap-with-key-pointer,virtual-call-ctor

Available checks:

bogus-dynamic-cast
foreacher
global-const-char-pointer
inefficient-qlist
qstring-uneeded-heap-allocations    (fix-qlatin1string-allocations,fix-fromLatin1_fromUtf8-allocations,fix-fromCharPtrAllocations)
function-args-by-ref
qmap-with-key-pointer
non-pod-global-static
reserve-candidates
variant-sanitizer
virtual-call-ctor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENABLING FIXITS

Some checks support fixits, in which clazy will re-write your source files whenever it can fix something.
You can enable a fixit through the env variable, for example:
export CLAZY_FIXIT="fix-qlatin1string-allocations"

Only one fixit can be enabled each time.
WARNING: Backup your code, don't blame me if a fixit is not applied correctly.
For better results don't use parallel builds, otherwise a fixit being applied in an header file might be done twice.
