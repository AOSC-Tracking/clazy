Checks from level3:
    assert-with-side-effects
    bogus-dynamic-cast
    detaching-member

If nothing is specified, all checks from level0 and level1 will be run.

To specify which checks to enable set the CLAZY_CHECKS env variable, for example:
    export CLAZY_CHECKS="level0"
    export CLAZY_CHECKS="level0,reserve-candidates,qstring-allocations"
    export CLAZY_CHECKS="reserve-candidates"

or pass as compiler arguments, for example:
    -Xclang -plugin-arg-clang-lazy -Xclang reserve-candidates,qstring-allocations

To enable FixIts for a check, also set the env variable CLAZY_FIXIT, for example:
    export CLAZY_FIXIT="fix-qlatin1string-allocations"

FixIts are experimental and rewrite your code therefore only one FixIt is allowed per build.
Specifying a list of different FixIts is not supported.
Backup your code before running them.
