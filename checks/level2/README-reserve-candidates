reserve-candidates

Recommends places that are missing reserve().
Supported containers are: QVector, std::vector, QList, QSet and QVarLengthArray.

Rate of false-positives is around 15%, so don't go blindly calling reserve() without proper review.
In doubt don't use it, since all containers have a growth curve so won't do N allocations when you append N items.


Trivial example missing reserve();

    QList<int> list;
    // list.reserve(list2.size());
    foreach (int i, list2)
        list << i

Example where reserve shouldn't be used:

    QList<int> list;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        list.reserve(2); // Reserve will be called 1000 times, meaning 1000 allocations, while without a reserve the internal growth algorithm would kickin
        for (int j = 0; j <= 2; ++j) {
            list << m;
        }
    }
