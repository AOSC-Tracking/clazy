inefficient-qlist-soft

A less aggressive version of inefficient-qlist.

Finds QList<T> where sizeof(T) > sizeof(void*). QVector<T> should be used instead.
Only warns if the container is a local variable and isn't passed to any method or returned,
unlike inefficient-qlist.

When there are source and binary compatibility concerns it's difficult to fix the warnings reported
by inefficient-qlist. The warnings reported by inefficient-qlist-soft should be easy to fix.
