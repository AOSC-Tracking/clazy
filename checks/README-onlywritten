only-written

Finds variables that are only written, not read, for example:
    int i = 0;
    ++i;

The variable must be a built-in type or a common Qt type. We don't enable it for
all types because lots of classes have const methods with side-effects, so we assume
calling a const-method wouldn't be a legitimate use.

This check is expensive and finds very few bugs, therefore it's hidden by default.
You have to explicitly enable it.
