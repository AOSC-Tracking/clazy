writing-to-temporary

Catches when calling setters on temporaries, for example:
widget->sizePolicy().setHorizontalStretch(1);

Which should instead be:
QSizePolicy sp = widget->sizePolicy();
sp.setHorizontalStretch(1);
widget->setSizePolicy(sp);

Requirements:
- The method must be of void return type
- It's name must start with "set"
