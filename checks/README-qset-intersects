qset-intersects

Finds cases where you're using set.intersect(other).isEmpty(), which is much slower than just calling QSet::intersects().
QSet::intersect() allocates memory and iterates the whole set.
QSet::intersects() bails out immediatley once one common item is found and doesn't allocate memory.

Requires Qt 5.6
