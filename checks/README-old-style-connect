old-style-connect

Finds usages of old style connects.

Old style syntax (SIGNAL/SLOT) is much slower than using pointer to member syntax (PMF).

WARNING: Although this check doesn't have false-positives it's a level2 check. It's disabled by default
since some connects are tricky to convert to PMF syntax and might introduce bugs if you don't know what you're doing.

If you do know what you're doing, then feel free to enable the fixit, which will convert the some cases for you:
export CLAZY_FIXIT=fix-old-style-connect

Here's a non-exhaustive list of caveats of PMF connects:
- You can't disconnect with new-syntax if the connect was made with old-syntax (and vice-versa)
- You can't disconnect from a static slot with new-syntax (although connecting works!)
- Difference in behaviour when calling slots of partially destroyed objects (https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/83800)
