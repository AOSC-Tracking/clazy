unused-non-trivial-variable

 Warns about unused Qt value classes.
 Compilers usually only warn when trivial classes are unused and don't emit warnings for non-trivial classes.

 This check has a whitelist of common Qt classes such as containers, QFont, QUrl, etc and warns for those too.

 See UnusedNonTrivialType::isInterestingType(QualType t) for a list of all types.
