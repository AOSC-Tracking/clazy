qstring-insensitive-allocation

Finds unneeded allocations such as:
    if (str.toLower().contains("foo"))

which you should fix as:
    if (str.contains("foo", Qt::CaseInsensitive))

to avoid the heap allocation caused by toLower().

Matches any of the following cases:
    str.{toLower, toUpper}().{contains, compare, startsWith, endsWith}()

Note:
    Qt::CaseInsensitive compare is different from toLower() comparison for a few code points, but it
    should be very rare: http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2016-February/024776.html
