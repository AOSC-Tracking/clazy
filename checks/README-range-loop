range-loop

Finds places where you're using C++11 range-loops with non-const Qt containers. (potential detach)
Fix it by marking the container const or by using a foreach, which is slightly less efficient, but
better than a detach.

Also warns if you're passing structs with non-trivial copy-ctor or non-trivial dtor by value, use
const-ref so that the copy-ctor and dtor don't get called.
